I started this portfolio project at the beginning of November 2023. 
The main target of this project is to present all my past experiences and personal projects.


The project is visible in this link : https://yuchenbao.com/


The UI of my portfolio consists of an iPhone-like component on the right and an iPad-like component on the left. 


In the iPhone-like component, you can access my CV and view my past projects. In the iPad-like component, I will create some fun content over time and share enjoyable moments from my life.
